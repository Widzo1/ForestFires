# ForestFires

<!-- badges: start -->
![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/Widzo1/ForestFires/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ForestFires is to present data for a particularly challenging regression task of predicting the size of the burned area using various meteorological measurements. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of ForestFires from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ForestFires")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(ForestFires)
## distribution of observations by month
library(tidyverse)
ForestFires%>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  summarize(count = n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = count)) + 
  geom_col(fill ="#3D9970") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Forest Fires by month")

## basic ggpairs for regression preliminary analysis
library(GGally)
ggpairs(data = ForestFires, columns = 7:13, title = "Basic scatter plot matrix")

```
